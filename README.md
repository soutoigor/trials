# **Trials**

Trials is a collection of simple APIs that you can use when you're trying a new technology or studying.  
It contains "famous" APIs, like TODOs and Blog (and that's is for now ðŸ˜œ). 

## Setup

You can run locally by following:

clone the project:  
`git clone git@github.com:soutoigor/trials.git`

Create a `.env` file and add the environment variables as in `.env.example` file  
(the local URL created by Docker is in the example, you can use it ðŸ¤™).  

Run Docker container:  
`docker-compose up`
  
Now it must be showing the message `App listening on port [PORT]!` in terminal.
